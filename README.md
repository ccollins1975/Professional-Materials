 # About the project
 This portfolio shows a few of the projects that I have recently completed during my full stack web development boot camp at UNC Charlotte. The technology used in all the projects range from HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Mongo DB, MYSQL, and React JS. On the group projects that are listed I did mostly front-end work but did help with some of the backend when needed.
 # About me
I have spent almost 30 years in the live entertainment technology industry. I have done everything from pushing cases across the stage to hanging lighting fixtures on a moving cruise ship. During the 30 years I also spent some time teaching high school and college students about theatrical lighting design and theatrical technology. With our new pandemic new normal I have decided that a career change was needed. Iâ€™ve always been fascinated with computers and how they work and with the web. After some research I decided that the best new career path I could take would web development. I looked at several different options from traditional schooling, self-study, and boot camps. I opted on the boot camp model which I have just completed.
